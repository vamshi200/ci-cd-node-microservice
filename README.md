# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Microservices — E-Commerce Order Processing System

## 📌 Project Theme & Goal

This project is a real-world simulation of an automated CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based architecture. The main theme is centered around an **E-commerce Order Processing System**, which is broken into independent, scalable microservices. The project showcases how to build, test, containerize, and deploy microservices efficiently using industry-standard DevOps tools and cloud-native practices.

### 🎯 Goals:
- Build a **production-ready pipeline**
- Adopt **modern DevOps tooling**
- Apply **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Prepare the app for **global deployment**

## 🧠 What This Project Teaches

- ✅ End-to-end DevOps workflow
- ✅ Docker containerization of microservices
- ✅ CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
- ✅ Load balancing and reverse proxy with NGINX
- ✅ Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- ✅ Cloud deployment strategies

## 🛍️ Real-World Use Case: E-Commerce Order Processing System

The microservices represent core components of an e-commerce platform:

1. **Order Service** – Handles creation and tracking of customer orders.
2. **Payment Service** – Simulates payment processing.
3. **Inventory Service** – Manages stock and availability of products.
4. **Notification Service** – Sends notifications after order/payment events.

Each service is isolated, containerized, and communicates with others via REST APIs.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. **Commit Code** → Code pushed to GitHub triggers GitHub Actions.
2. **Build Phase** → Node.js microservices are built and tested.
3. **Dockerize** → Each service is containerized with its own Dockerfile.
4. **Push to Docker Hub** *(optional)*
5. **Deploy** → Docker Compose spins up services or Terraform provisions infrastructure on the cloud.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests written using **Jest** or **Mocha**
- GitHub Actions runs tests on every push or PR
- Linting and formatting checks included for clean code practices

## 🌐 Deployment

- Locally with `docker-compose up`
- On the cloud using:
  - **AWS EC2** for VM-based hosting
  - **Terraform** to automate infrastructure setup
  - **NGINX** as a reverse proxy to route traffic to different services

> *Note: Each service can be extended with its own database or 3rd-party integration.*
